## About
Adult purple sea urchin GSI spanning and gonad protein concentration spanning 2022 - 2025. Larval recruitment is a work-in-progress file sourced from GitHub user Sam Bogan visualizing how recruitment changes over time with seawater temperatures.

## Creators
Sophia visualized GSI & protein data, assisted with data collection. Sam Bogan visualized larval recruitment data. SBC LTER collected the larval recruitment data.

## Data
- GSI & protein data are unavailable to the public currently
- Larval recruitment data is sourced from the [Santa Barbara Coastal Long Term Ecological Research Group](https://sbclter.msi.ucsb.edu/) - file must be downloaded from source tab due to size
- Temperature data collected from SBC LTER - files must be downloaded from source tab due to size
